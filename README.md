# MNIST-Digit-Classifier-using-Streamlit

## This project demonstrates a web application built with Streamlit to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset using a simple neural network model.

## Key Features:
1. Interactive Training: Users can train the model directly from the app with the MNIST dataset.
2. Image Visualization: Displays selected test images with their true and predicted labels.
3. Prediction Confidence: Provides confidence scores for the predicted digit.
4. Easy Deployment: Designed for simple and intuitive usage through Streamlit.


## Dependencies:
1. streamlit for creating the interactive user interface.
2. numpy for numerical computations.
3. matplotlib for plotting the test images.
4. keras for building and training the neural network.

## File Content:
1. app.py: Main file containing the Streamlit app code.
2. Includes functions to load, preprocess, train, and test the MNIST dataset.
